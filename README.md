# Social-Media-Network-Functionalities
-Created a consol based program on Social Network Functionalities using data structures like Graph and Linked List and chosen language is c++.<br>
-Ensured efficient traversal and manipulation of linked lists to maintain optimal performance even as the network grows.<br>
-The project contains functions like adding a user to the network,Finding Mutual Friends of two users,Displaying a userâ€™s friend list,etc...
Time Complexity :

Quick sort has been used to find mutual friends - O(n^2) for worst case and O(nlogn) for average case.

To find a member with maximum friends - O(n).

Adding members in the network - O(1).

Adding friends of the members - O(n).

Displaying friend list - O(n^2).

here's a demo of it
